# Appliance Procurement

* Choose the most efficient rating possible without breaking the bank. The return on investment is measurable especially if the appliance is properly looked after. [^1]

## Dishwasher
* Should have a dedicated shelf for cutlery. This gives a more efficient use of the overall usable volume
* Should have the ability to schedule delayed start. The convenience benefit of this feature allows the user to load the dishwasher earlier in the evening, schedule the delayed start and forget about it
* Should have a visibile indicator that the dishwasher is turned on. On some cycles or at the end of a cycle it is sometimes hard to dermine if the appliance is running
* Wi-Fi modules on this appliance, does not generally add much value

## Washing Machine & Dryer
* The ability to stack these appliances give the user flexibility when it comes to planning/ changing layouts. Most models allow this through an off the shelf attachment but some simply so not support this.
* Wi-Fi modules on these appliances, does not generally add much value

## Air-Conditioner
* Wi-Fi modules on this appliance give value in convenience. Being able to switch on an A/C ahead of time at the end of a journey will be a god send. These modules also give the ability to turn off A/C regardless if they're on or not -- this adds to strategicly being able to save on energy.
* When buying a home it is of utmost importance to make sure A/C copper pipes are able to efficiently be routed through your home. A/C copper pipes are expensive in material and gas top ups.

## Fridge & Freezer
* An alarm that sounds when the door is left open can save you from a bad day
* For in-built appliances of this nature it's recommended that you aim for quality rather than features
