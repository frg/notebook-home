# Maintenance

## Fridge
* From time to time food will touch the back of the condenser (back of the fridge), freeze, and over time will slowly find itself in the reservoir and decompose. If ignored the reservoir will clog up and water will leak out of the fridge. Depending on usage the fridge reservoir should be cleared thouroughly
* Food or packaging that has frozen against the condenser can be cleaned by leaving the fridge open for a few minutes until it melts enough to remove easily by hand. It's important not to use metal tools to remove this debris. This cleaning is ideal right before a big trip to the supermarket when the fridge is least empty

## Windows
* Over time the seal between windows and the wall will deteriorate. The seal should be inspected on a yearly basis after the hot summer months but before the wet season starts

## Bathroom
* If the sink has a push-to-open drain, make sure to occasionally close and open repeatedly a few times. Over time, especially in areas with a hard water, the lime in the water will accumulate against the mechanism and jam it up. Unjamming the mechanism is a frustrating task
* Be aware of any warping or expanding of any wooden furniture in a bathroom. Over time due to the moisture within a room of this kind it is expected that wood would degrade over time. However, depending on the wooden item this can be delayed years into its lifetime
* Be aware of any cracks formed over time within the shower floor. Hairline cracks often take months until serious damage is caused, left unchecked this can become a real headache. Depending on the existing sealing, re-grouting or re-sealing would solve this issue
